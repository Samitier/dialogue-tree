  But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?

JULES
  What?

VINCENT
  It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.

JULES
  Examples?

VINCENT
  Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

JULES
  They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

VINCENT
  No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
  What'd they call it?

VINCENT
  Royale with Cheese.

JULES
  Royale with Cheese? What'd they call a Big Mac?

VINCENT
  Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.

JULES
  Le Big Mac... What do they call a Whopper?

VINCENT
  I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.  But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?

JULES
  What?

VINCENT
  Mayonnaise.

JULES
  Goddamn!

VINCENT
  I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
  Uuccch!
