ROY BATTY
  I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. 
  
ROY BATTY
  Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. 
  
ROY BATTY
  I watched C-beams glitter in the darkness at Tannhauser Gate.

ROY BATTY
  All those moments will be lost in time...

ROY BATTY
  ...like tears in rain. 

ROY BATTY
  Time to die.
